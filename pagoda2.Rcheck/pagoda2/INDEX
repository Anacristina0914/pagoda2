getClusterLabelsFromSelection
                        Assign names to the clusters, given a
                        clustering vector and a set of selections. This
                        function will use a set of pagoda2 cell
                        seletcion to identify the clusters in a a named
                        factor. It is meant to be used to import user
                        defined annotations that are defined as
                        selections into a more formal categorization of
                        cells that are defined by cluster. To help with
                        this the function allows a percent of cells to
                        have been classified in the selections into
                        multiple groups, something which may be the
                        result of the users making wrong selections.
                        The percent of cells allows to be multiselected
                        in any given group is defined by
                        multiClassCutoff. Furthermore the method will
                        assign each cluster to a selection only if the
                        most popular cluster to the next most popular
                        exceed the ambiguous.ratio in terms of cell
                        numbers. If a cluster does not satisfy this
                        condtiion it is not assigned.
